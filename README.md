This PHP-based project incorporates a robust user role system, empowering various users with distinct capabilities to effectively manage and access student report cards. By defining multiple user roles, the application offers enhanced functionality tailored to the needs of both teachers and students.

With this system in place, teachers are granted the privilege to input grades and track academic progress for individual students. They can easily navigate the interface to maintain accurate records of students' performance.

On the other hand, students are provided secure access to view and display their personalized report cards. This enables them to monitor their academic achievements, identify areas of improvement, and stay informed about their overall academic standing.

The user role system ensures that only authorized users, such as teachers and students, have access to relevant functionalities while maintaining data privacy and security. It fosters a seamless and efficient communication channel between educators and learners, facilitating a collaborative learning environment and promoting academic growth.
